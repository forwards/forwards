Various measures were taken to protect anonymity
of the respondents and avoid disclosure of sensitive information. In
particular the following questions/variables are completely excluded:
\describe{
        \item{Q1}{What did you register as at useR! 2016?}
        \item{Q4}{To what racial or ethnic group(s) do you identify?}
        \item{Q5}{In what country do you currently reside?}
        \item{Q6}{Do you identify as LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Asexual
        and/or Transgender)?}
        \item{Q9}{Is your current job:
        \itemize{
            \item Full-time
            \item Part-time
            \item I am not currently employed
       }}
       \item{Q10}{Are you a caregiver for children or adult dependents on a
       regular basis?}
       \item{Q23_B}{Specific reason for not attending a user group}
       \item{Q24_M}{Specific location/demographic/domain/language etc for which
       the respondent would like a user group/workshop/other support}
       \item{Q25}{What other ideas do you have for improving the R community?}
       \item{Q26}{Do you have any feedback for the survey authors?}
}
Summaries of all these variables have been presented in blog posts
 (see references). Q1, Q9 and Q10 were used in multivariate analyses (see
references) but Q9 and Q10 did not feature in the interpretation and Q1 has
inconsistencies with Q8. For the latter we give priority to Q8, the
employment status of respondents at the time they completed the survey.

Of the remaining variables, we consider Q2, Q3, Q7, Q8, Q11, and Q13_F to be
implicit identifiers (key variables). These variables were modified to
achieve 3-anonymity, i.e. the smallest subgroup identifiable from
combinations of these variables is at least of size 3. In particular, the
following modifications were made
\describe{
    \item{Q2}{Non-binary grouped with missing; all other key variables for
    this group suppressed (set to NA).}
    \item{Q3}{Year of birth converted to approximate age groups: "> 35" and
    "35 and under"; age group suppressed for 14 individuals.}
    \item{Q7}{Highest education level aggregated to two groups:
    "Doctorate/Professional" and "Masters and under"; highest education level
    suppressed for 3 individuals.}
    \item{Q8}{Employment status aggregated to three groups: "Non-academic"
    (includes employment in industry, government, non-profit, self-employed)
    and "Academic" (includes retired, unemployed, student).}
    \item{Q11}{Length of R usage aggregated to four groups: combined groups
    corresponding to shortest times into "< 2 years" group.}
    \item{Q13_F}{Suppressed for two individuals.}
}
In addition specific values containing personal/personally identifiable
information were suppressed in Q19_H, Q22_B and Q23_B.

\examples{
# cross-tabulate age and length of time using R
xtabs(~ Q3 + Q11, data = useR2016)

# fit a logistic regression with "contribute to or write packages" predicted by
# gender, length of R usage, employment status, and community belonging
response <- with(useR2016,
    ifelse(!is.na(Q13_D) | !is.na(Q13_E) | !is.na(Q13_F), 1, 0))
glm(response ~ Q2 + Q11 + Q8 + Q18, data = useR2016)
